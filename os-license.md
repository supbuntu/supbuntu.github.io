# oSup License v1

## Foreword
Software is a computer element that must always be the good companion of man (that is, of the human being). That is why this license is designed to offer free and secure software. No vulnerabilities. That is, with all its patches, closed its code, and free for everyone. That does not mean, lose money. You can include your internal elements for purchases or propose donations and contributions. It is always seen from the perspective of having a safe software, but free, that for everyone is the idea of ​​the `oFree code`. The `oFreeSoft` method is an idea that your software is free, and I emphasize. Only for download and installation. Not including third-party programs, which normally install hidden items on the computer. But you rule in it, and if you want to include internal purchases, just do it. But yes, it notifies your users (those who will download and install the software) that there are purchases within it. I say this especially because there will be software with this license that will be intended for a child audience, and if it is not notified, there may be a misunderstanding. To consult everything related to oFreeSoft and internal purchases see the `oSoftPay` section

## Chapter 1: Disclamer
### 1.1: Codename
The following license is published under the version name: "Dance Pool Party" ...

### 1.2: Things to consider when using this license
The use of this license must be like this:

- You must include this document UNMODIFIED, always in a clear and easy-to-read format and with all the elements.
- All the software that uses this license, must COMPLY WITH EVERYTHING that it entails.
- The developer can include purchases within their software, ALWAYS AND WHEN NOTIFYING IT IN THE INSTALLER OR IN AN INITIAL WINDOW AND IN THE HELP SECTION IN THE MENU.

### 1.3: oFree Method
The oFree method is about your software being able to be used by anyone, for free at the start. *You can find more information in the "oFree" section*
### 1.4: Freedom to create and distribute
The developer can make with his software any idea captured in his mind, as long as his intention is to help the user in his task or make him have a good time. Like for example an office program or a game. The software must always be free at the beginning, from its download to its installation and use. No creating licensing programs or using network activators. It is said that any software that you have to pay to use can be vulnerable for the simple fact of paying for it. However, if you use the option to include purchases within such software, you can consult the `oSoftPay` section below
### 1.5: No to cybercrime
The creator of the software must create content that provides the user with always legal and accessible content. We say it, because any software must have a specific function. For example: A P2P or BitTorrent client is used to share large files between users. As well as, for example, a source code of a software among its developers or part of it. But realizing that everyone uses BitTorrent to download illegal movies and P2P to transfer child pornography.

oSup wants to promote the cleaning of the software not as its code, but the function that its users do with it. If x developer performs a specific P2P to publish school bullying, or x developer performs a specific BitTorrent to transfer malicious software source code. We are totally against them doing so. This is how this license marks it. If a user makes software with such infringements, they can send us an email to: osup-licensing@gmail.com
### 1.6: No need for developer accounts or posting to a marketplace
For the normal user, one who uses a computer. It will be easy to google for software, but those who normally use Linux are used to a Marketplace. oSup pretends that nobody has to go through a developer filter, or a filter to publish, since we do not want the software to concentrate. You can concentrate, and any developer can create a concentration of such software either qualified under this license (software within software with the same license) or deferred license software. (software with dual licenses). This only applies to the completion of creating a Marketplace for software and applies only in case of creating a Marketplace software with this current license.

### 1.7: Attributions
The developer is free to attribute to any:

- Person
- Organization
- Developer
- Translator
- Designer
- etc.

As long as the software is under this license. You are forced to put the attributions in the software installer (in case of not putting in an installer either by using linux, then you are forced to put it in the Help menu. Where is it: About, License, etc.)
## Chapter 2: oSoftPay
This chapter is quite long and sensitive to explain.

The use of the software created under this license must always be enhanced by the freedom of use, and of course purchases within said software can be included whenever notified, also including the possibility of donations and contributions. Contributions are generally based on volunteer developers (as long as they are always credited to the software), see `oFree` section.

For the user who uses the software to declare either within the installer and even within the help menu (and to see an initial box that can be closed in which includes a notice that their software includes purchases) the developer can put even a text at the top right. See the section `supDevFree`

Children may misuse the software if the developer does not declare such a function. That is why you must declare if there are purchases within it.

Any infringement of this license related to the purchase within the software can be sent to: osup-licensing@gmail.com

## Chapter 3: supDevFree

The goal of the developer is to create software and distribute it and with it, his idea is reflected in many many computer computers.

Thus, you have complete freedom of construction, language and everything, this license offers the guarantee that the software you install will give you enough confidence to install it. As long as the requirements mentioned throughout the chapters (better known as sections) are met, in terms of creativity we leave everything to the developer and that he is the one who offers his software, and makes it visible.

This license alone refers to the fact that we are fighting to eradicate piracy and cybercrime. As well as avoiding the use of software to transfer bullying or child pornography. Everything is possible. But we all

## Termination of this license
It is appreciated that there are people who want to promote their software towards a creative and safe side, both for young people and adults. Always from a technical and legal perspective.

The software will be as you have wanted to design it. Since we will always fight for legality and reliability as well as free and secure access for everyone and everywhere.
